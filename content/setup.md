## ðŸ’» My Everyday Tech

### Main Device
**13-inch MacBook Air M1** - Small, light, and gets the job done. Perfect for working, browsing, or just binge-watching stuff.

### Phone
**iPhone 13** - I mostly use it for:  
- **X (Twitter)** - To see what's happening out there  
- **Messages** - Staying in touch with people that matter  

### Coding Environment
**VS Code** - My go-to editor for most coding work. Clean, fast, and has all the extensions I need.

**Google Colab** - Perfect for machine learning experiments and when I need that GPU power without burning my laptop.

**Vim** - Currently trying to learn this. It's frustrating but I can see why people love it. Still accidentally typing `:wq` in other editors though.

I try to keep my digital life as simple as possible less noise, more useful stuff.
